# K-Means-cluststering-LR-Classifier

In this project we implemented K means clustering in 1st part of the project.
In the second part of the project we implemented LR classifier and applied active learning strategies such as Random Sampling and Uncertainity based Sampling on MMI and Mind reading datasets.
The project was implemented in Matlab.
